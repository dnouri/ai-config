/**
 * PiSay extension - Extension UI Protocol Test Harness
 *
 * A π mascot that exercises extension UI APIs for manual testing.
 * Useful for verifying RPC protocol support in alternative frontends (e.g., Emacs).
 *
 * Usage: /pisay [message]    - displays a message with ASCII pi mascot
 *        /pisay              - displays a fortune (if installed)
 *
 * Protocol tests (ctx.ui.*):
 *        /pisay confirm      - test confirm() dialog
 *        /pisay select       - test select() dialog
 *        /pisay input        - test input() single-line dialog
 *        /pisay editor-dialog - test editor() multi-line dialog
 *        /pisay notify       - test notify() notifications
 *        /pisay status       - test setStatus() footer status
 *        /pisay editor       - test setEditorText() editor prefill
 *        /pisay widget       - test setWidget() above/below editor
 *        /pisay title        - test setTitle() terminal title
 *
 * Other APIs tested:
 *        pi.registerCommand(), pi.registerMessageRenderer(),
 *        pi.sendMessage(), pi.exec(), @mariozechner/pi-tui Box/Text
 *
 * Put this in ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pisay.ts
